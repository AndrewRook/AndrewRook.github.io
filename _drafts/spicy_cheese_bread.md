Wisconsin: land of [beer](https://newglarusbrewing.com/), 
[bratwurst](https://statestreetbrats.com/), and 
[cheddar cheese](http://hookscheese.com/). I consumed copious amounts
of all three during my time as a grad student at UW-Madison, but none
is the food that I miss the most. That honor is reserved for spicy
cheese bread.

Specifically, [Stella's spicy cheese bread](https://stellasofmadison.com/), 
a staple food of any trip to the 
[Dane County Farmers' Market](https://dcfm.org/)[^dcfm]. Summers in 
Wisconsin are gorgeous, and the market is a must-do destination every
week when the weather is nice. 

We'd walk the mile or so from our house
to the Capital and enter the market across from State Street. This
is just downstream of Stella's — foot traffic in the market is
strictly one-way[^counterclockwise] — and I'm not too proud to admit
that we would cut against the flow for the 10 feet or so necessary to get to
the side of the bakery's booth which was dispensing the bread, then waiting
in the informal queue of customers before handing over the cash for our 
fresh-from-the-oven prize. 

And what a prize it was! Over a pound of a sweet, tender, yeasty bread spotted with
mildly spicy red pepper flakes, stuffed with just so much gooey, melty cheese.
We'd join the regular flow of the market, bread in hand, ripping off chunks and
stuffing our faces while browsing the other stalls of the market. 

## The Recipe

### Ingredients

**Dough**
* 280 grams bread flour
* 140 grams water
* 40 grams granulated sugar
* 2 tablespoons room-temperature butter (~30 grams)
* 1 teaspoon instant yeast (~5 grams)
* 1/2 teaspoon salt (~4 grams)
* 1 large egg
* 1 teaspoon dried parsley
* 1 teaspoon dried chives
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes
* 75 grams mild provolone
* 75 grams monterey jack

**Topping**
* 1 large egg
* 1 tablespoon water
* 1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes

**Tools**
* Stand mixer
* Small cake pan
* Large pot, large enough to fit over the cake pan
* Baking sheet
* Cooking spray
* Plastic wrap
* Rolling pin
* Pastry brush

#### Notes
* If you only have active dry yeast, use the same amount but first warm up some of the water
to ~100 degrees F, then dissolve the yeast in the water for 5 minutes.
* You may want to adjust the amount of red pepper flakes depending on
your spice tolerance and the particular brand of pepper flakes you have.
* The provolone should **not** be smoked or sharp. It may be difficult to find a
block of provolone that isn't smoked/sharp, in which case you can use
pre-sliced bagged provolone.

### Instructions
1. Put all of the dough ingredients except for the cheeses in the bowl of a stand mixer. 
1. Attach the dough hook to the stand mixer and run at low speed until the
dough comes together, about a minute. Then turn to medium-low speed and
knead about 5 minutes. The dough should be strong enough to hang off the
hook without breaking. It may be very sticky: that's fine for right now.
1. Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and cover with plastic wrap.
Let rise in a warm place for about 90 minutes, until a little less than doubled in volume. 
Check after an hour or so; rise times can be variable.
1. While the dough is rising, take both cheeses out of the fridge and cut
into roughly 1/2-inch cubes (if provolone is pre-sliced, cut into 1/2-inch slices).
Leave cheese out on counter to come to room temperature (cold cheese can slow down
the second rise). 
1. Clear a flat workspace and spray it with cooking spray. Also spray
the rolling pin and cake pan. Turn the dough out onto the greased workspace. If it is
still sticky, so sticky that working with it is difficult, dust with additional flour
until it becomes possible to handle it. 
1. Roll out the dough into about a 15"x12" rectangle. Scatter the cheese over the 
entire area of the dough save for about 1/2-inch on all sides. Roll dough up along
the short axis to make a log and pinch ends to seal.
1. Turn log seam-side down, then roll it out with your hands until it is about
25" long — long enough for you to tie the dough into a loose knot by looping
one end under the other and pulling up through the middle, which you should do next.
1. Gently place the dough into the cake pan, recover with the plastic wrap, and
let rise in a warm place for another 60-90 minutes. Dough may not quite double
in bulk but should at least be noticeably bigger than before, and feel softer
to the touch than it was right after it was knotted.
1. While dough is rising, move the oven racks to a low enough position to comfortably 
fit the pot, place the pot in the oven, and preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.
1. When dough has risen, place cake pan with dough on the baking sheet,
remove the pot from the oven, then place the pot upside-down over the cake pan
and on the baking sheet. Put sheet-pan-pot assemblage into the oven and bake
for 20 minutes. 
1. While the dough bakes, make the egg wash by scrambling the egg inside
a small container, then mixing in the water. Get out the red pepper flakes and
set aside.
1. Remove sheet-pan-pot assemblage from the oven, take off pot, then brush
the egg wash on the dough and then sprinkle with the red pepper flakes. Return
the sheet and pan to the oven without the pot, then bake for an additional 10-15
minutes, until the crust is browned and/or you can't resist the delicious smell anymore.
1. Remove pan from oven and let bread cool for at least 10 minutes before eating.
Optionally, remove bread from pan and place on a cooling rack to speed up the process.

    Almost certainly the largest farmers' market in the entire country,
    every Saturday in the Summer the Dane County Farmers' Market runs for four 
    solid city blocks and wraps
    entirely around the Wisconsin Capital Building.
