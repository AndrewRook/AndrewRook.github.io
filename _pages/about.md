# `whoami`

I'm a Data Scientist, with a broad range of experience over all stages
of the model lifecycle and with a wide range of data. Past projects
include building core models to underwrite credit card approvals,
designing and maintaining standalone tools to help analyze data more
efficently, and building pipelines to automatically process, align, and stack
hundreds of astronomical images.

While in past lives I was a daily user of C++ and (gasp) Fortran77,
for the past several years my go-to programming language has been
Python. I care deeply about the design and quality of the software I
build, I'm familiar with handling problems with datasets large enough
to strain the memory of a single machine, and I know _just_ enough
distributed computing to get myself thoroughly into trouble.

# `whatisthis`

Sometimes, when the mood strikes me, I do side-projects. I
find them useful both to learn new tools and also to keep my skills
sharp, but really I do them because I get curious (or angry) about
something and I can't really help myself from digging in.

Usually these projects peter out fairly quickly without any concrete
results: I realize they're much more complicated than I initially
thought, I get distracted by some other shiny thing, or real life
intervenes for long enough that when I have free time again I've lost
interest. But sometimes I'm able to carry them forward for long enough
to find out something that I think is neat, and it seemed sad not to
be able to tell people about it[^football].

So I slapped together this
site to serve as a central clearinghouse for whatever I wanted to
write about. I make no promises on when (or if) I'll post anything,
but when I get the urge to share here's where it'll go. Enjoy!


[^football]:
    Years ago I did some analyses specifically
    about (American) football to help build a portfolio for my initial
    move into Data Science, which I [published online](https://phdfootball.blogspot.com/) mostly so there
    would be a paper trail if anyone ever tried to verify my
    resume. Since then, however, a) my interests have expanded beyond
    football and b) blogspot kind of sucked, so I figured it made sense
    to put new material on a different site. This one!
