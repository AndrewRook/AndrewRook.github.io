# `whoami`

I'm a Data Scientist, with a broad range of experience over all stages
of the model lifecycle and with a wide range of data. Past projects
include building core models to underwrite credit card approvals,
designing and maintaining standalone tools to help analyze data more
efficently, and building pipelines to automatically process, align, and stack
hundreds of astronomical images.

While in past lives I was a daily user of C++ and (gasp) Fortran77,
for the past several years my go-to programming language has been
Python. I care deeply about the design and quality of the software I
build, I'm familiar with handling problems with datasets large enough
to strain the memory of a single machine, and I know _just_ enough
distributed computing to get myself thoroughly into trouble.

# `whatisthis`
Part location to share interesting analysis from 
side-projects, part hub for any opinions I wish to share about
the world, and part clearinghouse for rants on things 
that annoy me, this blog is a centralized place for me to put my
writing[^football]. Generally I'm interested in using data to learn
new things, trying out new tools and techniques for analysis, and 
looking skeptically at commonly accepted (or at least unquestioned)
wisdom. I make no promises on when (or if) I'll post anything,
but when I get the urge to share here's where it'll go. Enjoy!


[^football]:
    Years ago I did some analyses specifically
    about (American) football to help build a portfolio for my initial
    move into Data Science, which I [published online](https://phdfootball.blogspot.com/) mostly so there
    would be a paper trail if anyone ever tried to verify my
    claims. Since then, however, a) my interests have expanded beyond
    football and b) blogspot kind of sucked, so I figured it made sense
    to put new material on a different site. This one!
